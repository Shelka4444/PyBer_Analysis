# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to extract information in the ride-sharing data provided by a private company. This dataset is from 2019, and contains information about city type (rural, suburban, and urban), fares, drivers, dates, and also the number of rides taken. Data was analyzed and presented in a series of charts which visually represent otherwise invisible trends throughout each locality. This information can then be used to develop nuanced business strategies to help the company achieve its goals. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
