# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to extract information in the ride-sharing data provided by a private company. This dataset is from 2019, and contains information about city type (rural, suburban, and urban), fares, drivers, dates, and also the number of rides taken. Data was analyzed and presented in a series of charts which visually represent otherwise invisible trends throughout each locality. This information can then be used to develop nuanced business strategies to help the company achieve its goals. 

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Examining the line chart, "Total Fares by City Type", it is easy to see that the urban cities consistently had a higher total fare amount than either suburban or rural cities, with suburban cities earning more than rural cities. From January through April 2019, the urban cities earned a total of 2x that of suburban cities and almost 10x that of their rural counterparts.

During this time period, the average total earned for urban cities was approximately $2,180 per month, for suburban cities the average total was approximately $1,052 per month, and for rural cities the average total was approximately $230 per month. The line chart in combination with the descriptive statistcs of each area also illustrate the maximum and minimum total fares per month from January through April 2019: urban cities with a max of $2,471 and min of $1,662; suburban cities with a max of $1,413 and min of $722; and rural cities with a max of $501 and min of $68.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
